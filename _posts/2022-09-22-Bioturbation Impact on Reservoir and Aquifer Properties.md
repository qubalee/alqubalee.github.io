## Bioturbation Impact on Reservoir and Aquifer Properties

**Summary**

Bioturbation is a process involving organisms interacting with sediments. Buatois and Mangano (2011) summarize the products of such a process, including biogenic and bioerosional sedimentary structures and others. The biogenic structures included bioturbated structures (i.e., tracks, trails, burrows, and similar structures), bio depositional structures (i.e., fecal pellets, pseudofeces, products of bioerosion, and similar structures), and biostratification structures (i.e., biogenic graded bedding, byssal mats, certain stromatolites, and similar structures). Bioerosion sedimentary structures (i.e., borings, gnawings, scrapings, bitings, and related traces) and other evidence of an organismâ€™s activity (i.e., spider webs and egg cases). Many reports have shown that bioturbation could enhance or reduce reservoir quality. However, the bioturbation impact on reservoir or aquifer properties depends on several factors, mainly bioturbation intensity and connectivity. Our efforts in this direction can be classified into two parts. In the first one, we worked on enhancing bioturbation quantification through multiple integrated approaches, while in the other one, we investigated the impact of burrows on reservoir properties.
